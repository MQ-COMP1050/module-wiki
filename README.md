# Final Exam Companion Handout

Students are invited to contribute to [the wiki](https://github.com/MQ-COMP1050/module-wiki/wiki) in this repo. It contains a markdown file for both the practice exam and the final exam.

* We will print the first 2 pages of each page print them on paper.
* The printed pages will be handed out at the respective exam.
* We will use the version a day before the respective exam.
* You *cannot* print them out yourself, to take to the exam. You can only bring a pen or pencil, and of course, your photo ID.
* If these pages are empty we will hand out empty pages.

Of course, the normal rules for editing public documents at a university apply. We reserve the right to edit the document if it contains offensive or unsuitable content.
